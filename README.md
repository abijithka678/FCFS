# Process Scheduling Algorithm - README

This is a simple C program that implements the First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) process scheduling algorithm. It calculates the waiting time and turnaround time for a set of processes based on their burst times.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- You need a C compiler installed on your system to compile and run the program.
- For example, you can use GCC (GNU Compiler Collection).

### Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Process-Scheduling-Algorithm.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

   ```bash
   cd Process-Scheduling-Algorithm
   ```

3. Compile the program:

   ```bash
   gcc -o scheduler scheduler.c
   ```

4. Run the compiled program:

   ```bash
   ./scheduler
   ```

5. Follow the prompts to input the number of processes and their burst times. The program will display the calculated waiting times and turnaround times for each process.
